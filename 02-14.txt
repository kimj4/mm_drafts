**Tex Yoda II - - - $290 shipped conus**

- pictures: https://imgur.com/a/NYghn
- Repaired: the stem on the trackpoint module fell off at some point, so I superglued it back on. The repaired joint is solid, and aligned as would be normal
- 65g zealio stems in Bsun Brown housings for the main keyboard, and regular 65g zealios on the mouse buttons
- Some of the stems are a darker color. The guy I bought the zeals from did a spring swap. They are all indeed 65g.
- Space gray color
- LEDs can be installed, but I have not done so.
- Regular top printed keycaps
- Comers with the rest of the keycaps, 7u stab wire, some more screws, white leds, some Tex stickers, a couple replacement nubs (everything that came with the kit)
- will ship with the trackpoint module uninstalled to prevent damage.
